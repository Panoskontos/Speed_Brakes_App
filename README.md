# Speed_Brakes_App

This project involves the development of an Android application and Firebase Database designed for use in a vehicle or transportation context. The primary functionalities of this application include recording braking, abrupt accelerations, and accelerations up to a global speed limit of 100 km/h.

Key features to be implemented include:

Remote Data Logging: All data collected by the application will be logged remotely on a proposed network such as Firebase.
User Identification and Authentication: All users interacting with the application need to be identified and authenticated, with Firebase being the suggested method for this process.

Event Timestamps and Location: Each event recorded by the application should be timestamped and associated with a geographic location, similar to Task 1.

Data Visualization: The application should be capable of displaying aggregated and anonymized data from all users on a Google Maps interface, with various filters based on the data recorded, like showing points where speeding occurred.
