# Speed_Brakes_App


The project involves developing an Android application that functions while the user is in a vehicle or transport and aims to record instances of sudden "braking." The application will utilize the GPS sensor and require the user's permission to record negative acceleration values (indicating deceleration or braking) above a predefined threshold. For each recorded event, the application will store the timestamp and the corresponding location. The recorded events can be visualized on Google Maps, allowing users to view them geographically.
